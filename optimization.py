"""There could be several reasons for a connection error in a Streamlit app, including:

Network issues: If there is an issue with your internet connection or the server hosting the app, you may experience a connection error.

Firewall restrictions: If a firewall is blocking access to the app, you may not be able to connect.

Incorrect URL or port: If the URL or port for the app is incorrect, you may experience a connection error.

Unresponsive server: If the server hosting the app is not responding, you may experience a connection error.

Code errors: If there is an error in the code of the app, it may not be able to run properly and you may experience a connection error.

It is important to troubleshoot each of these potential issues in order to resolve the connection error.
SOLVING THE PROBLEMS 
To resolve a connection error in a Streamlit app, try the following steps:

Check your internet connection and make sure it is stable.

Disable any firewalls temporarily and try connecting again to see if they were causing the issue.

Verify that the URL and port for the app are correct and match the expected values.

Check if the server hosting the app is responsive by attempting to access it from a web browser or via ping command.

Review the code of the app for any errors and fix any bugs that are identified.

If none of these steps resolve the connection error, you may need to seek assistance from the support team for the app or from a software developer with experience in Streamlit.
HOW CACHING WORKS 
Caching in Streamlit refers to the process of storing the results of a computation or data processing in memory
, so that subsequent requests for the same data can be served more quickly without having to perform the same 
computation again. This helps to reduce the latency and improve the overall performance of a Streamlit app, 
particularly for large or complex data sets.

In Streamlit, caching can be implemented using the st.cache decorator. 
This decorator can be applied to a function that performs a computation or data processing, and Streamlit will
automatically cache the result of the function and reuse it for subsequent calls, as long as the inputs to the 
function remain the same. This can help to significantly speed up the performance of a Streamlit app, 
especially when working with large or complex data sets.
